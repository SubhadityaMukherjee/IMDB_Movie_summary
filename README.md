## IMDB Scraper

I like to keep my movies in folders with each folder having the name of the movie.
This project goes through every such folder and gets the summary from imdb and saves it as a text file in that folder.

Useful for when you have too many movies and you really dont remember which is what.

*Note: No APIs at all. Just web scraping*
